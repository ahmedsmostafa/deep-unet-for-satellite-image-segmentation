# MAGIC ## About this project
# MAGIC This is a Keras based implementation of a deep UNet that performs satellite image segmentation.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ## Dataset
# MAGIC * The dataset consists of 8-band commercial grade satellite imagery taken from SpaceNet dataset.
# MAGIC * Train collection contains few tiff files for each of the 24 locations.
# MAGIC * Every location has an 8-channel image containing spectral information of several wavelength channels (red, red edge, coastal, blue, green, yellow, near-IR1 and near-IR2). These files are located in data/mband/ directory.
# MAGIC * Also available are correctly segmented images of each training location, called mask. These files contain information about 5 different classes: buildings, roads, trees, crops and water (note that original Kaggle contest had 10 classes).
# MAGIC * Resolution for satellite images s 16-bit. However, mask-files are 8-bit.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ## Implementation
# MAGIC * Deep Unet architecture is employed to perform segmentation.
# MAGIC * Image augmentation is used for input images to significantly increases train data.
# MAGIC * Image augmentation is also done while testing, mean results are exported to result.tif image.
